; This is an example of passive script - it doesn't execute

; `user-query` is not defined in the script, but it will be evaluated
; in the context of the parent script, where it is expected to be defined
(user (user-query))

; The content of messages will be evaluated at each llm call, so
; they can contain some MeTTa code
; TODO: unfortunately, atm, it cannot contain functions defined in the script itself,
;       because the script is evaluated in the different context
