# image_handler - image handler
# You can subscribe for the following topics using node.create_subscription:
#     - "/stt/sentence_topic" to get sentences from STT
#     - "/stt/event_topic" events from STT (speechstart speechcont speechstop)
#     - "/tts/said_utterances" - to get utterances which was said by TTS
# You should use:
# stt.publish_realtime function to simulate receiving sentence via STT approximately in realtime with all corresponding events
# stt.publish_direct function to directly send sentence to "/stt/sentence_topic" (simulation of user typing something in GUI)
